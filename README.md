# Weather App Development Challenge

## Introduction
Welcome to our Weather App development challenge! This project is designed to assess your coding skills, creativity, and ability to work with different APIs and responsive design principles. You are free to choose the technology stack (e.g., React, Vue, Angular for frontend; Node.js, Flask, Django for backend, etc.) that best suits your skills.

## Objective
Your task is to create a weather application that allows users to search for weather conditions based on their location. The app should dynamically update its background and icons according to the current weather conditions.

## Features

### 1. Location and Weather Search
- Implement a search feature that allows users to enter a location (city, zip code, etc.).
- Display the current weather information for the selected location, including temperature, humidity, wind speed, and a brief description (e.g., sunny, cloudy, rainy).

### 2. Dynamic Background
- The application's background should change based on the current weather conditions.
  - Sunny: Bright or sunny background.
  - Cloudy: Cloudy or overcast background.
  - Rainy: Rainy or stormy background.

### 3. Weather Icons
- Display dynamic weather icons that reflect the current weather condition.
  - Use distinct icons for sunny, cloudy, and rainy conditions.

### 4. Responsive Design
- Ensure that your application is responsive and provides a seamless experience across different devices and screen sizes.

### 5. Deployment (Bonus)
- Optionally, deploy your application to a cloud service (e.g., Vercel, Netlify, Heroku, AWS, etc.). Provide the URL to the deployed application in your submission.

## Evaluation Criteria
- **Functionality**: The app accurately performs all the described features.
- **Code Quality**: The code is clean, well-organized, and commented where necessary.
- **Design and User Experience**: The app is intuitive to use and visually appealing.
- **Creativity and Innovation**: Use of innovative solutions and features to enhance the user experience.
- **Adaptability**: The application should be responsive and work across different devices and browsers.
- **Deployment**: Bonus points for successfully deploying the app and sharing a live URL.

## Submission Guidelines
- Your project should be submitted as a link to a GitHub repository.
- Ensure all commit and push history is open and remains visible in the repository to demonstrate your work process.
- Include a README file in your repository with:
  - Instructions on how to run your application.
  - A brief explanation of your technology choice and any libraries or APIs used.
  - (If applicable) The URL to the deployed application.
- Ensure your application does not require any special credentials to run, or provide them in a secure manner within your submission.

## Time Limit
- You have 24 hours from the time you receive this challenge to submit your project.

## Resources
- You may use any public API for weather data, such as OpenWeatherMap, Weatherstack, or any other of your choice.
- Feel free to use any libraries or frameworks that you are comfortable with to achieve the project goals.

Good luck, and we're excited to see what you build!
